# Task Management App

## Description

The Task Management App is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently.

- **Form Validation**: User-friendly form with input validation for adding new tasks.
- **API Integration**: Mock REST API (using Axios) to fetch, add, update, and delete tasks.
- **Pagination**: A paginated task list for better performance and usability.
- **Styling**: Responsive and modern UI using Ant Design components.
- **User Feedback**: Notifications for success and error messages using Ant Designâ€™s Notification component.
